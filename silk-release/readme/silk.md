# silk

Silk is an open-source, [CNI](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/)-compatible container networking fabric.
It was inspired by the [flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel) VXLAN backend and designed to meet the strict
operational requirements of [Cloud Foundry](https://cloudfoundry.org/platform/).
