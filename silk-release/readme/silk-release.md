# silk-release

This repository is a [BOSH](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) release for
deploying silk container networking plugin to Cloud Foundry in conjunction with [CF Networking
Release](https://code.cloudfoundry.org/cf-networking-release). It provides
networking via the Silk CNI plugin and enforces policy that is stored in the
Policy Server.

For information on getting started with Cloud Foundry look at the docs for
[CF Deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment).
